# coffee-roaster

I'm making a coffee roaster. Using a bread maker and a heat gun (a popular name for such an abomination is a corretto roaster). The source code for the Arduino snippet needed for temperature monitoring through the Artisan roasting software is included in the src folder.

The roaster, particularly the Arduino sketch, is based on Luke Grasse's Arduino controlled popcorn machine based roaster, from his Medium post: https://medium.com/@lukasgrasse/how-to-make-an-arduino-controlled-coffee-roaster-f6a3334fd7d5 
The Arduino sketch is modified slightly to use fewer digital pins, and adding support for an environment temperature sensor as well.
