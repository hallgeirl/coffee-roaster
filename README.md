# coffee-roaster

I'm making a coffee roaster using a bread maker and a heat gun (a popular name for such an abomination is a corretto roaster). The source code for the Arduino snippet needed for temperature monitoring through the Artisan roasting software is included in the src folder.

# Next steps
* Improve the lid. Having a wooden lid on a coffee roaster is kind of a fire hazard.
* Properly insulating the bread pan.

# Credits
The roaster, particularly the Arduino sketch, is based on Luke Grasse's Arduino controlled popcorn machine based roaster, from his Medium post: https://medium.com/@lukasgrasse/how-to-make-an-arduino-controlled-coffee-roaster-f6a3334fd7d5 
The Arduino sketch is modified slightly to use fewer digital pins, and adding support for an environment temperature sensor as well.
