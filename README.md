# DIY Coffee Roasters

I've tinkered a bit at home with creating coffee roasters (one created, one in planning) that are both more powerful and cheaper than the typical consumer-targetted coffee roasters out there. Obviously, I can't compete with professional coffee roasters, and that's not the intention. Also, my coffee roaster(s) are not revolutionary in any way, and there's some REALLY impressive projects out there that blows me away. However:
* There's few build instructions for simple but effective coffee roasters out there.
* Some of the builds out there, like some of the DIY drum roasters, are SUPER impressive, but is way beyond the scope for a "regular" person to build, if your interests are first of all in coffee roasting, not building roasters.

Additionally, I wanted a place to document my own work in creating a coffee roaster. So, this repository was born.

# My roaster(s)
I have one finished roaster, as well as one that I have started to plan to build:
1. An Arduino controlled heat gun + bread machine roaster. This is my current "production" roaster. I've roasted almost 30kg in total on this roaster now, with great success. I haven't tested the limits of the capacity of this roaster, but I roast 600 gram batches. Probably could go to 800 grams. You can find some high level instructions and schematics for this roaster in the [README.md file in the v1 folder](v1/README.md).
2. I plan to build a drum roaster as well with even more capacity, possibly gas-heated. It's barely even on the planning stage - but you can find whatever I have so far in [README.md file in the v2 folder](v2/README.md).
