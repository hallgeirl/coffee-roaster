# DIY computer controlled drum roaster

I'm planning to make a drum roaster as a successor to my heat gun + bread machine roaster. This is in the planning stages.

# Disclaimer
I take absolutely no responsibility for ANY damage that may occur. If you make a roaster, you make it ENTIRELY on your own risk. I am not an electrician myself, but I'm experienced enough to take the neccessary precautions when I work on this project. If you are not, please get some training beforehand!

Also, this is not a definitive guide to how to make a roaster. Many of the steps are quite superficial, but if you've got some experience with tinkering and electrical systems it should be fairly straight forward to fill in the blanks. If not, don't hesitate to create an issue in this github repo and I'll try to answer and/or extend this readme.

# Planned features
* High capacity (for a home roaster) (1200g+).
* Bean + environment temperature monitoring through Artisan.
* Build simplicity will be important.
* ...

# Requirements
* Experience in working with electrical systems.
* Some handy-ness in actually building stuff. There are some parts that can be a bit tricky (e.g. making a round hole in a steel plate, steel cutting, general assembly).

# Parts
* Drum: 200mm pipe (Planning to use a pipe that is usually used for ovens)
* Arduino/Rasberry pi?

# Safety precautions
* You're dealing with high voltages here, which can kill you. Be careful! :-) If you are not familiar with electrical systems, DO NOT start this project without some training.
* The bread pan will be VERY hot when roasting, so use an oven mitt or something when emptying it.
* Never leave the outlet of the roaster plugged in. ALWAYS unplug it after use. I ONLY plug it in when I roast.
* Some people recommend to sand off any teflon coating in the bread pan due to off-gassing.

# Build steps
TBD
